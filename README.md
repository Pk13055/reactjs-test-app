# ReactJS basics

Basic routing and template functionality explained. Code is pretty
self-explanatory, but any clarifications will be made here.

## Setup

First get node and npm setup on your computer. Check if properly installed by
running, `node --version; npm --version`. Once that's done, all that's left it
to start. (PS: React does cover some _new_ ES6, you can read up on [arrow
functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
if you're unfamiliar with the same)

## Creating the app

Once you've set up node and npm, we will first have to install
`create-react-app`.
```
sudo -EH npm install -g create-react-app nodemon
create-react-app testapp
```
After you've installed this, all you have to do is `cd testapp` and `nodemon
.` and you're ready to start developing. You can take a look at
[this](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) tutorial that walks you
through the basics of creating an app.
